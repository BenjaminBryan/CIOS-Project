Edit as we go!
This README file will explain the function of our point of sale software, how it works and how to use it.
This is a point of sale system which contains a database through sql containing a list of the inventory (random items).
The list holds item number, name and price and the user will use the GUI to select items and add them to their (cart) list.
Once the list is complete (up to user) a preview of the items and their prices will be shown when clicking confirm, the properly taxed sum of all the selected items will be shown too.

Background

A point of sale system is designed to provide information to the business owner. Using this information, they can predict with clarity from daily sales volume to inventory information. All this data helps the small business owners increase profits and reduce stress. The ways to achieve this goal is either by reducing operating costs or by increasing sales. Point of sales performs both functions. It reduces operating costs and increases net income by an increasing sale.
